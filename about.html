                Noobgramming Adventures is a personal project made by a noobgrammer.
                The goal is to learn how to code from scratch and share all the things
                this noobgrammer learns by making "fun" <i>(hopefully)</i> and informative content!
            </div>

            <h1 class="about-content-subhead">Who is behind this?</h1>
            <div class="about-paragraph">
                I'm not sure why you would ask but the man behind this is "Tres."
                Someone who is interested in learning how to write words that do
                stuffs. He also loves his stupid ideas. One of which is the creation
                of this thing you're seeing right now!

            <h1 class="about-content-subhead">Why Are You Doing This?</h1>
            <div class="about-paragraph">
                I'm not trying to torture anyone by exposing the noob's programming
                perspective. I only do this for two reasons:
                <ol class="about-list">
                    <li>- a refresher for me when I become less noob;</li>
                    <li>- helping hand to other people who are in similar position to me;</li>
                    <li>- to have fun learning!</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="about-paragraph"><i>(wait... that's more than two, isn't it?)</i></div>
            <div class="about-paragraph">
                Anyway, doing simple monotoned tutorial or guides are not fun for me.
                I also don't want look like some of those "superior" content creators who
                act like they know everything and they're always right.
            </div>
            <div class="about-paragraph-last">
                And that's when I thought of making this unusual content!
                The birth of the Noobgrammer and Noobgramming Adventures!
