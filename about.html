                <div class=about-paragraph>Noobgramming Adventures is a personal project made by a noobgrammer. The goal
                    is to learn how to code from scratch and share all the things this noobgrammer learns by making
                    "fun" <i>(hopefully)</i> and informative content!</div><br><br><br><a href=project.html

                <div class=about-paragraph>I'm not sure why you would ask but the man behind this is "Tres." Someone who
                    is interested in learning how to write words that do stuffs. He also loves his stupid ideas. One of
                    which is the creation of this thing you're seeing right now!<br><br>If you somehow feel like you
                    want to see more of me, I demand a cup of coffee! You can also find more ways to see me by checking

                <div class=about-paragraph>I'm not trying to torture anyone by exposing the noob's programming
                    perspective. I only do this for two reasons:<ul class=about-list>
                        <li>a refresher for me when I become less noob;
                        <li>helping hand to other people who are in similar position to me;
                        <li>to have fun learning!
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class=about-paragraph><i>(wait... that's more than two, isn't it?)</i></div>
                <div class=about-paragraph>Anyway, doing simple monotoned tutorial or guides are not fun for me. I also
                    don't want look like some of those "superior" content creators who act like they know everything and
                    they're always right.</div>
                <div class=about-paragraph-last>And that's when I thought of making this unusual content! The birth of
