                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The noob behind this page marks the first official day of documenting his "Noobgramming Adventures!"</p>
                <p>A bit of an ambitious quest but hey, it's better than to do nothing at all!</p>
                <p>Today, we're venturing headfirst into the world of a-bunch-of-letters-that-do-stuff!</p>
                <p>But fear not, my fellow noobgrammers! Today's main course is HTML, a language that sounds way more intimidating than it actually is.</p>

            
                <h2>What We're Supposed to Learn:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What HTML is and its role in web development</li>
                    <li>Setting up your coding environment</li>
                    <li>Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document</li>
                    <li>Saving and previewing your very first HTML document</li>
                    <li>HTML elements and tags</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>What HTML is and its role in web development</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is like the bread
                    and butter of the web. It's the language that allows
                    us to structure and organize content on web pages.
                </p>
                    Think of it like the building blocks of a website -
                    the invisible skeleton that holds everything together.
                <p>
                <p>

                </p>
                    Imagine HTML as the blueprint of a building - it defines
                    the layout, sections, and content structure of a webpage.
                </p>

                <h2>Setting up your coding environment</h2>
                <p>
                    Before we start our HTML adventure, let's make sure that you
                    have a coding environment to actually type something that
                    can do stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple text editor like Notepad (for Windows) or TextEdit
                    (for Mac) will do just fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I like to use Visual Studio Code because... well,
                    that's the only text editor I know how to use.
                </p>
                <p>Let's do some HTML, shall we?</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Basic Structure</h2>
                <p>Here's the Gist:</p>
                <p>
                    HTML uses these nifty little things called "tags" to tell a
                    web browser what to display and how to structure it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like writing secret instructions, except everyone can
                    see them (kind of like leaving a note for your roommate in
                    giant neon letters).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, let's say I want to write a super basic webpage
                    with a heading that screams "Noobmgramming Adventures!"
                    in all its glory. Here's the HTML code for that bad boy:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                        &lt;html&gt;
                            &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;title&gt;Noobgramming Adventures!&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;/head&gt;
                            &lt;body&gt;
                                &lt;h1&gt;Noobgramming Adventures!&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    <h3>Output:</h3>
                    <code>
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                            <html>
                                <head>
                                    <title>Noobgramming Adventures!</title>
                                </head>
                                <body>
                                    <h1>Noobgramming Adventures!</h1>
                                </body>
                            </html>
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Woah, hold on there, turbo! Let's break it down bit by bit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This is like the intro, telling the
                        browser we're dealing with an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>&lt;html&gt;: Opens the HTML playground.</li>
                    <li>&lt;head&gt;: Holds the backstage info, like the title that
                        shows up on your browser tab
                        (the "Noobmgramming Adventures!" part).</li>
                    <li>&lt;body&gt;: Here's where the party happens! This is where
                        all the content people actually see gets written.</li>
                    <li>&lt;h1&gt;: This tag throws a giant headline onto the page,
                        which is where my epic adventure title lives.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Saving and previewing your very first HTML document</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, the coolest part? You can actually see this come to life by
                    saving this code as an HTML file (like "index.html") and opening
                    it in a web browser.
                </p>
                <img src="" alt="screenshot of opening the HTML document in a web browser.">
                <p>
                    Boom! There you have it, your very first webpage – a testament to
                    your glorious noobness (and a stepper to coding greatness, obviously).
                </p>
            
                <h2>HTML elements and tags</h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, this is just the HTML appetizer. There's a whole buffet of
                    tags and tricks waiting to be explored. Here are some of the commonly
                    used HTML elements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;:
                    These are headings of varying sizes, used to organize content hierarchically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;p&gt;: This element defines a paragraph of text.
                        Imagine you're writing a super interesting blog post
                        (like this one, obviously). The &lt;p&gt; tag is your workhorse for creating
                        those easy-to-read blocks of text.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;: These elements create unordered and ordered lists,
                        respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do you have a list of your favorite coding tutorials? Maybe some essential tools
                    for aspiring noobs? Here's where these tags come in. Use &lt;ol&gt; for numbered lists
                        (think step-by-step instructions) and &lt;ul&gt; for unordered lists (perfect for
                        those random brainstorming ideas).
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;li&gt;: This element represents a list item within a list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &lt;a&gt;: This element creates hyperlinks,
                        allowing users to navigate between web pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine you're writing about a mind-blowing coding resource (like this one).
                    &lt;a&gt; tag allows users to navigate your webpage (and maybe even link to this
                        awesome blog).
                </p>
                <p>&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; tags: bolds and italicize texts.</p>
                <p>
                    Want to emphasize a key point?
                    Slap a &lt;b&gt; tag on it and watch it become bold!
                    Feeling a bit more subtle?
                    &lt;i&gt; makes text italic. But listen up –
                        there are actually more modern and semantic
                        alternatives we'll explore later
                        (spoiler alert: they're way more efficient).
                </p>
                <p>&lt;br&gt; tags: create line breaks and control the flow of your content.</p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, you just need a clean break in your text.
                    That's where the &lt;br&gt; tag swoops in – a simple yet powerful
                    tool for adding line breaks and controlling the layout of
                    your webpage.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>

                    You've (hopefully) learned the basics of HTML, its
                    foundational elements, and even created your very first
                    HTML document. But remember that this is just the beginning
                    of the noobest programming journey!
                </p>
                <p>
