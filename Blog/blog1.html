                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The noob behind this page marks the first official day of documenting his "Noobgramming Adventures!"</p>
                <p>A bit of an ambitious quest but hey, it's better than to do nothing at all!</p>
                <p>Today, we're venturing headfirst into the world of a-bunch-of-letters-that-do-stuff!</p>
                <p>But fear not, my fellow noobgrammers! Today's main course is HTML, a language that sounds way more intimidating than it actually is.</p>

            
                <h2>What We're Supposed to Learn:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>What HTML is and its role in web development</li>
                    <li>Setting up your coding environment</li>
                    <li>Understanding the basic structure of an HTML document</li>

                    <li>HTML elements and tags</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h2>What HTML is and its role in web development</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is like the bread
                    and butter of the web. It's the language that allows
                    us to structure and organize content on web pages.
                </p>
                    Think of it like the building blocks of a website -
                    the invisible skeleton that holds everything together.
                <p>
                <p>

                </p>
                    Imagine HTML as the blueprint of a building - it defines
                    the layout, sections, and content structure of a webpage.
                </p>

                <h2>Setting up your coding environment</h2>
                <p>
                    Before we start our HTML adventure, let's make sure that you
                    have a coding environment to actually type something that
                    can do stuff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple text editor like Notepad (for Windows) or TextEdit
                    (for Mac) will do just fine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personally, I like to use Visual Studio Code because... well,
                    that's the only text editor I know how to use.
                </p>
                <p>Let's do some HTML, shall we?</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Basic Structure</h2>
                <p>Here's the Gist:</p>
                <p>
                    HTML uses these nifty little things called "tags" to tell a
                    web browser what to display and how to structure it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's like writing secret instructions, except everyone can
                    see them (kind of like leaving a note for your roommate in
                    giant neon letters).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, let's say I want to write a super basic webpage
                    with a heading that screams "Noobmgramming Adventures!"
                    in all its glory. Here's the HTML code for that bad boy:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                        &lt;html&gt;
                            &lt;head&gt;
                                &lt;title&gt;Noobgramming Adventures!&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;/head&gt;
                            &lt;body&gt;
                                &lt;h1&gt;Noobgramming Adventures!&lt;/h1&gt;
                            &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    <h3>Output:</h3>
                    <code>
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                            <html>
                                <head>
                                    <title>Noobgramming Adventures!</title>
                                </head>
                                <body>
                                    <h1>Noobgramming Adventures!</h1>
                                </body>
                            </html>
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>Woah, hold on there, turbo! Let's break it down bit by bit:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;: This is like the intro, telling the
                        browser we're dealing with an HTML document.</li>
                    <li>&lt;html&gt;: Opens the HTML playground.</li>
                    <li>&lt;head&gt;: Holds the backstage info, like the title that
                        shows up on your browser tab
                        (the "Noobmgramming Adventures!" part).</li>
                    <li>&lt;body&gt;: Here's where the party happens! This is where
                        all the content people actually see gets written.</li>
                    <li>&lt;h1&gt;: This tag throws a giant headline onto the page,
                        which is where my epic adventure title lives.</li>

                </ul>

                <h2>Saving and previewing your very first HTML document</h2>
                <p>
                    Now, the coolest part? You can actually see this come to life by
                    saving this code as an HTML file (like "index.html") and opening
                    it in a web browser.
                </p>
                <img src="" alt="screenshot of opening the HTML document in a web browser.">
                <p>
                    Boom! There you have it, your very first webpage â€“ a testament to
                    your glorious noobness (and a stepper to coding greatness, obviously).
                </p>
            
                <h2>HTML elements and tags</h2>
                <p>
                    Of course, this is just the HTML appetizer. There's a whole buffet of
                    tags and tricks waiting to be explored. Here are some of the commonly
                    used HTML elements:
                </p>
                <h2>&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, &lt;h6&gt;</h2>
                <p>These are headings of varying sizes, used to organize content hierarchically. Think of them like titles and subtitles in a book. The higher the number, the smaller the heading.</p>

                <h2>&lt;p&gt;</h2>
                <p>This element defines a paragraph of text. It's like writing a block of text that's easy to read and understand. Use it for writing paragraphs, just like you would in a book.</p>

                <h2>&lt;ul&gt; and &lt;ol&gt;</h2>
                <p>These elements create lists. &lt;ul&gt; creates unordered lists (with bullet points), while &lt;ol&gt; creates ordered lists (with numbers or letters).</p>

                <h2>&lt;li&gt;</h2>
                <p>This element represents a list item within a list. It's like writing down each item in your shopping list. Each item starts with this tag.</p>

                <h2>&lt;a&gt;</h2>
                <p>This element creates hyperlinks, allowing users to navigate between web pages. Think of it as a door that leads you to another room (or webpage) on the internet.</p>

                <h2>&lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt;</h2>
                <p>&lt;b&gt; makes text bold, while &lt;i&gt; italicizes text. They're used to add emphasis to certain words or phrases. But remember, there are more modern and efficient ways to style text.</p>

                <h2>&lt;br&gt;</h2>
                <p>This tag creates line breaks, allowing you to control the flow of your content. It's like pressing "Enter" on your keyboard to start a new line in a document.</p>

                <p>That's it for our HTML elements and tags overview! With these basics, you're well on your way to mastering HTML and building awesome web pages.</p>


                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Congratulations! We've successfully navigated through

                    HTML document. But remember that this is just the beginning
                    of the noobest programming journey!
                </p>
